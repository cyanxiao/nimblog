# Contribution
Run `yarn add` to install all dependencies.

Nimblog uses Parcel as the build tool. Run `yarn dev` to make live changes to the project. Run `yarn build` to build the production version.

Note that Parcel does not support invoking static assets natively, so static files are put in `\static` to make sure they can be accessed with HMR.
